# README

With this Patch, you can show the latest Notarization data on a Insight Explorer.

Works with Decker's repo: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install/ (Install all Komodo ecosystem daemons and explorers)

or my repo: https://github.com/gcharang/komodo-install-explorer (Useful to install just an explorer for a Komodo ecosystem daemon and blockchain you already have)

## Installation

You can use the patch like so:

```bash
#"cd" into the directory where the explorer is installed. i.e., the directories "SMARTCHAINNAME-explorer" and this repo should be on the same level
git clone https://github.com/gcharang/explorer-notarized
cd explorer-notarized
./patch.sh SMARTCHAINNAME
```

## Apply custom styles to the explorer

After the patch is appled,

- Step1: `cd` to the directory: `SMARTCHAINNAME-explorer/node_modules/insight-ui-komodo/public`

- Step2: Edit the `index.html` in that directory to remove the comment:

```md
<!---Remove this comment, add a file named './css/common.min.css' in '/public' with the styles you want to override <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/common.min.css"> -->
```

and replace it with the line:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/common.min.css">
```

- Step3: Replace the existing `./css/common.min.css` (if it exists) with `./src/css/common.css`

```bash
cp ./src/css/common.css ./css/common.min.css
```

- Step4: Look at the file `./css/common.min.css` and change the styles that you wish to. These changes will override the styles defined in `./css/main.min.css`.

- Step5: Example can be seen at https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install/tree/master/overlay/BNTN-explorer/node_modules/insight-ui-komodo/public

**Note:** Regarding `css` and `views` in the above directory; Don't replace the files from the patch with these files directly, you will lose the notarization enhancements. See what changes were made by comparing with the files in the patch and just make those changes.
